#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:

a = float(input("Enter first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter second number: "))

addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b

print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)
